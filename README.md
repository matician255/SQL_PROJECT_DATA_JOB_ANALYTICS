# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used 
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Scientist Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name as company_name

FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id

WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 10

```

### Key Insights:
- Staff Data Scientist roles command the highest salaries, with Quant Researcher positions topping the list at $550,000
- Selby Jennings and Demandbase appear twice each in the top 10 paying jobs
- All top 10 positions offer remote work ("Anywhere" location)
- Director and Head of Data Science roles dominate the high-paying positions
- There's a significant drop between the top 2 salaries ($525K+) and the rest ($375K and below)

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name as company_name

    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id

    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC

    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
top_paying_jobs.*,
skills

FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id=skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```


### Insights

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Scientist
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id=skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```
### Key insight
- The dataset shows that **Python** leads in demand with a count of 10,390, which is significantly higher than the next highest skill (**SQL** at 7,488). This suggests that Python is in particularly high demand compared to other skills listed.


 | skills  | demand_count |  
 |---------|--------------|  
 | python  | 10390        |  
 | sql     | 7488         |  
 | r       | 4674         |  
 | aws     | 2593         |  
 | tableau | 2458         |

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id=skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25
```
### Insights
- Regulatory and privacy expertise (GDPR) is highly valued.
- Programming languages like Golang, Rust, and Julia command high salaries.
- Cloud and data engineering skills (DynamoDB, Redis, Cassandra) are lucrative.
- Machine learning automation and computer vision (DataRobot, OpenCV) are in high demand.
- Business intelligence tools still offer strong earning potential.

### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn
Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and have high salaries, offering a strategic focus for skill development.

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
   
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id=skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING 
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
### Insight
